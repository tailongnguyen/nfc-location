# INTRODUCTION
This dataset contains over 750 images of NFC locations on 13 phone brands. We at [KALAPA JSC](https://kalapa.vn) started building it at the beginning of 2023 using the following methods:

- Crawling images directly from the official websites of phone manufacturers.
- Crawling User Manual documents from the official websites of phone manufacturers. Then, using language and image processing algorithms to extract NFC locations and manually verifying them.
- Watching disassembly videos and identifying NFC locations.

# DISCLAIMER
During the data-building process, **errors may occur**, and we highly appreciate contributions from the community to make the dataset more complete, helping individuals and organizations in verifying NFC locations.
